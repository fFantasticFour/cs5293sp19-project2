If you were young when rock-and-roll was young, then you will probably enjoy this; if you were not young at that time, then this would give you a bit of history. Even though I was not around for the era of the big bands, seeing movies like "The Glenn Miller Story" or listening to some █████ ████ or █████ ██████ gave me an appreciation for the music of a previous generation, and an understanding that those of that generation are not hopelessly antiquated.<br /><br />The bulk of the movie is footage of a concert in St. Louis at the Fox Theater in celebration of Berry's 60th birthday in 1986. Berry plays a lot of his classics - he was still an amazingly agile and robust performer at the time. █████ ████████ plays a big part in this movie. Apparently Richards was bothered by the fact that Berry always picked up lackluster backup bands wherever he played and he put together a good backup band for this concert, himself included of course. There are guest appearances by ████ ███████, ██████ ████, █████ ████████, ████ █████, and ██████ ██████. There are interviews with Bo Diddley, the Everly Brothers, █████ █████████, ███ ███████, ██████ ███████ (a delight), ████ ██████, █████ ███████████, and much talk from █████ ████████. The fact that Richards is still alive at this late date is a testament to the resilience of the human body.
