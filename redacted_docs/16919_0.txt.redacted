A Perfect Murder ( a loose remake of Dial M for Murder ) is a<br /><br />stylish thriller in its own right ,but doesn't come close to the<br /><br />original. As I remember and not to give away any of the plot, Dial<br /><br />M' is all about the key. Where it is hidden, Who knew it was there,<br /><br />and who finds it. This plot line is gripping, but in Perfect ██████████ █████ />this whole part of the story has been overlooked. Having said that<br /><br />the film still works quite well, thanks to ███████ ███████. He really<br /><br />is superb. ███████ ████████ looks stunning, but █████ ██████ is<br /><br />wasted as the detective. But where the film really falls down is the<br /><br />ending. In the original the last scenes are gripping in the hunt for<br /><br />the key, but for some reason director ██████ █████ sees fit to end<br /><br />with the standard formula of a shoot out. Having said that the film<br /><br />is still worth seeing, but if you need to watch this story, I<br /><br />recommend the original.<br /><br />
