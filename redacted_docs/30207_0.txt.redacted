This was the kind of movie....that I thought was amusing and sweet for a low budget flick! It had some mistakes...but 'so what' all movies do...even blockbusters! I would watch the young sexy actress/rapper ██████ ██████...over and over again, she's HOT!! ████████ ███ is always funny, especially when he gets angry...Remember House Party 3? Singing was 'shaky' but I really did enjoy the rap numbers...especially the one's by Mysterious and Tangerine.....The white, black rap was kind of funny, but could have been just a bit better.....But it was worth it just watching Tangy (██████ ██████). Oops, back to Boobie again...."She's Hot"!! I thought that was ███████ ████████ as the butler...I thought it was cool for him to get a 'bit' part!
