Someone said that if you want to know them you're funny, don't tell them you're funny, tell them a joke. In this case, the last laugh is on the audience. ████ █████████████ movie is all telling and zero demonstration. Irrespective of temperament and motivation, his characters preach to the camera on the corruptive influence of mainstream television, the liberating powers of learning and movies as a moral institution. At no point in the story do we have any idea why the characters behave the way they do. Laughable. Three reasons to see "████ ██████" anyway: Rainer's initial display of road rage that leaves even a group of short-tempered skinheads green with fear, an amusing portrayal of a nameless millionaire's wife, and the very lovely ████ ███████. It's obvious she can't act, but with face and grace like that, she should have no trouble at all finding work as a model. - Guest appearance by █████ ███████. God knows what's gotten into her.
