I have seen most of ███ ██████████ movies, and I feel that this may, perhaps, be his best effort. I have seen this movie half a dozen times, and it continues not to bore me. The story was different and interesting. Admittedly, there are a few instances the when the acting isn't Academy Award caliber, but on the whole this was very good entertainment.<br /><br />After seeing this movie, I felt that ███ ████████ would definitely have a been a more preferable choice than ██████ ███████ in "The Horse Whisperer".
