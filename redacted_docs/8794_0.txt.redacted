████ ██████..who could not find fault with this██████ ████e menagerie of models & Marxists? Here, even the most inept of film-schoolers could find a surplus of shortfalls, for which to offer their trite insight. What's blatantly apparent with █████ ███ is...the script seems never to have transcended the first-draft stage...the characters all seem either to be on psychotropic drugs, or██████ ███ne██████ █████therapeutic ones...and the director seems to have had his mind on other things  perhaps how to act in his small but completely forgettable part.<br /><br />However, for some of us, the challenge is to discover the good points of 'critical failures', such as "Exposed", and as everyone seems to be somewhat more then vaguely awar████ ██████ost r███████ ███████this film is, in a word, "NASTASSJAKINSKI"! When she is before the camera, all the problems behind it seem insignificant.<br /><br />Cheers, J.B. - Prospect Point Productions, Inc.██████ █████
