This is a very enjoyable and underrated Swayze revenge film, that's pretty well made, with fantastic performances all around!. All The characters are wonderful, and the story was pretty cool, plus ███████ ██████ is simply amazing in this!. ████ ██████ and ███████ ██████ shared an excellent bond as brothers and had fantastic chemistry together, and i thought ████ ███████, was wonderful as the main villain, plus the finale was quite exciting!. Most of the critics panned this, and i can't see why, it's got plenty of action, suspense, and fantastic performances, plus i thought Swayze's acting was fantastic!. The fight between Neeson and Swayze at the bar was very realistic and tense, and this features ███ ███████ in a very different and early role!, plus The ending was very surprising in my opinion!. Sure it may not be exactly original, but i really enjoyed as you care for the main characters,and root for them, plus it has quite a few powerful and shocking moments as well!. This is a very enjoyable and underrated Swayze revenge film. that's pretty well made, with fantastic performances all around!, i highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. ████ █████ does a very good job here, with great camera work, good angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace!. The Acting is fantastic!. ███████ ██████ is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, very convincing, fantastic in the acting department, had excellent chemistry with ████ ██████, and ██████ ████, did awesome in his emotional scenes, and was just a lot of fun to watch!. (Swazye Rules!). ████ ██████ is fantastic as the brother, he made a great vigilante, had excellent chemistry with Swayze, was very intense, and was really into his role!, i loved him.████ ███████ is wonderful as the main villain, he is extremely sadistic, cold, although that smug smile of his made me want to slap him silly, i hated his character, and he played it really well, one of my favorite performances ever by a villain!. █████ ████ is very good with what she had to do as Swayze's wife, and had good chemistry with him. ███ ███████ is AMAZING as always, and is amazing here, although he didn't have much screen time, he had a great character, he was so vulnerable, and i just couldn't help but like his character i really felt sorry for him, he rocked! (███████ █████!). ███████ ████████ is good as the father and did what he had to do well. ████ ██████,███████ ██████████ and ███ ██████ all do great in there small roles. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5
