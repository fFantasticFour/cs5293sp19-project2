As █████ █████ said in his review, brilliant, literate film noir with excellent performances...particularly █████ █████████ as the femme fatale. A steamy seductress tried to seduce a cop with her beauty and stunning abilities as a pianist. ██████ ███████ is the cello play cop who wanders into a nest of thieves...some brutal the other weirdly comical. ████████ ███████ to the core. Well worth your seeing.
