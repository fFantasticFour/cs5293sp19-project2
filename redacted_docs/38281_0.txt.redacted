The teenager ███████ ███████ (█████ ██████) is traumatized by the loss of her deranged father when she was nine yearold and the suicide of her beloved brother Brandon one year ago. She decides to join the Richard Miller University, where Brandon committed suicide, to overcome her demons. While walking to her dorm, she meets the weird janitor ██████ ██████ (███ ██████) that tells her that the place is haunted. Madison befriends the recovering drug addicted Holt (████ █████████); the geek outcast String (████ █████); the sexually abused Ivy (█████ ███████) and Maya (Carolina Garcia); and the joker athlete Tommy (██████ ██████████). All the schoolmates have traumas and the veteran Rez (███████ ████) is responsible for them. String discovers in Internet that in 1935, their dorm together with an attached abandoned section was an asylum administrated by Dr. ██████ █████ (████ ███████) and considered a safe refugee for troubled teenagers with state-of-art treatment. However, in 1939, the interns uprose against the insane doctor, killing and disclosing the truth about his treatment. Sooner they find that their dorm is haunted by Dr. Burke that is seeking for tortured souls.<br /><br />The lame "Asylum" is a forgettable collection of clichés that do not frighten or make laugh. The villain Dr. Burke slightly recalls ██████ ███████ with his sharp blades and bringing nightmarish memories to his victims. The characters are destroyed the same way they appear, without any development or care with the consequences. In accordance with the story, Mackey was eleven year-old in 1939. Therefore, in 2007, he would be seventy-nine year-old, still working and in an excellent shape. In the end, I would like to give my suffering for watching this terrible movie. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Asylum  Não Estamos Sozinhos" ("Asylum  We Are not Alone")
