Chic beauty ████ ███████ (as ███████ ████ aka "Dot" Burton) supplants hard times as an actress by joining a group of bank robbers. Unfortunately, Ms. Emerson's carefully planned plot to rob the "Central Trust and Savings Bank" of $40,000 goes awry, when her getaway car driver, a young ██████ ███████ (as Wilson), parks in the red. Big mistake. Mr. Gleason draws the attention of a passing policeman, and Emerson is left holding the bag. Love interest █████ ██████ (as ███████ ████████) tries to keep Emerson out of women's prison. Fortunately, he is unsuccessful, and Emerson serves a intermittently amusing sentence, with █████ ██████ (as ██████ ████), and other beautifully coiffed women behind bars.<br /><br />*** ████ ████████ (1942) ██████ █████████████████████, █████ ██████, ██████ ███████
